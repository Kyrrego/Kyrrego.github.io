  How does the human brain respond while watching movies, and what can this reveal about individual traits? In this work, we show that certain movie clips can predict cognitive scores and sex from fMRI functional connectivity more effectively than five times as much resting-state data. For cognition prediction, a movie clipâ€™s predictive power is strongly linked to how well it synchronizes brain activity across people and to the amount of social and human-related content. These effects were not observed for sex prediction.
